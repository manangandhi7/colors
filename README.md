# colors
Ready to use easy and intuitive color transformations.

This repository Standardizes different color encoding schemes and their transformations. This package is the go to repo for such kind of transformations. 

Currently supports transformation with Red and Green colors only. Many more transformations are coming soon. 

Feel free to try it and report issues or create a pull request if you would like to make some contributions.

Feel free to use this code for any open source/public codes. Talk to me if you want to use it for Enterprise applications.
